CSS-02 Rules:

1) Selector 	- means which element we have to select
2) Properties 	- means what we want to apply on that selector (eg.color,background-color
				  font size etc...)

selector{property:value; property:valu;}
		 delclaration1	 delclaration2

h1{color:red; background-color:yellow;}

so here
what is h1 - selector
what is color - property
what is red - value
