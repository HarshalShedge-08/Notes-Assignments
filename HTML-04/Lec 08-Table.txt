Tables:
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

<table></table>

Table Rows:
Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag.
tr stands for table row.

Table Cells:
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.
td stands for table data.

Table Headers:
Sometimes you want your cells to be headers. 
In those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag:
By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered

<table></table>
<tr></tr>
<td></td>
<th></th>
